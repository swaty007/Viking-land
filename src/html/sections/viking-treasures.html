            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                The Vikings legacy to the modern world is much more varied than one would think. The artefacts found in archeological sites give us a much better understanding of the Vikings as a society, but also as individuals: their fears, their beliefs, the importance of arts and creativity, including theater or philosophy, and more…

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                The Vikings treasured cats both as important domestic animals who kept the mouse population at bay, and as symbols of the fertility goddess Freya. This small cat, made of baltic amber, was lost by someone in the trading town of Birka. Maybe an artisan made it for himself, or it was used as an amulet to ensure fertility.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                This tiny 1.8 cm high figurine shows the king of the gods, Odin, on his throne with his ravens Hugin and Munin. His dress is unusual; he seems to be wearing female dress and a pearl necklace. Odin was a god who transcended sex and normal conduct, so it is possible he is sitting on his throne in drag. Maybe he is assuming the persona and wisdom of the Volva – the great female shaman.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                This felt mask of an animal, maybe a wolf, is a testament to a lost Viking theater tradition. It would have been worn during a performance. The wolf was a
                symbolic animal connected to war, ferocity and the god Odin. This mask was found in harbour sediment in the once-Danish trading town of Hedeby, now in Germany.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                This mask-runestone from Århus in Denmark depicts the Great Beast, which became a popular symbol on stones and other items in the latter part of the Viking Age. Maybe it was used to protect a traveller against evil spirits in the lakes or rivers he had to cross. The Great Beast can also be found on a memorial stone erected in memory of the warrior Ful, “who died when kings fought”.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                The Vikings really loved their jewellery. This enormous gold torque from the religious and political site of Kalmergården (Tissø, Denmark) may have adorned a statue of one of the Viking gods, or been a gift from a king - a symbol of a powerful alliance. The necklace is from another central site in Denmark, Lejre. Its glass and rock beads were probably collected from many different places and could have been the prized possession of a freewoman.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Sometime in the early 800s, a Viking was contemplating his role in the cosmos, and came to the inevitable conclusion that the world he inhabited contained much more than he would ever be able to comprehend. "Man knows little" he carved on this piece of wood, as a way of revealing the true scope of his knowledge.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Only one almost complete Viking helmet has ever been recovered. But in this carved moose antler from Sigtuna in Sweden, we meet a helmet-wearing Viking warrior face to face. It’s a sober but powerful image. The well-groomed, bearded warrior, with his conical ‘spangenhelm’, is smiling slightly. You can really feel his presence.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                This small, somewhat crudely made, silver cup was found inside the burial mound of the first known Danish king, Gorm the Old, in Jelling, Denmark. Its particular decorative design had never been observed before, and gave its name to the Jelling style of ornamentation. Gorm’s son, Harald Bluetooth, went on to conquer large parts of Scandinavia, and his grandson, Svein Tjuguskjegg, conquered England.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Magic, strange beings and illness were a part of daily life for the Vikings. They were always on the lookout for powerful amulets to protect themselves with. This one must have been especially effective. It’s a piece of a human skull, carved with magical runes which call upon several forces, including Odin himself, to protect the bearer against an ache caused by the dwarf Bour.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Five beautifully carved animal heads were discovered at the Oseberg burial site. They were bound with a rope that ran through the mouth of one of the animal heads like a rein. This rope was attached to rattles. The animals were either fierce fighting dogs or bears. Their heads were made by different wood-carvers, and two of them were decorated with silver rivets. This one is called “the Academician”, because of the high quality, methodical way that it has been carved.

                Viking artisans produced objects of immense beauty and quality. This Bamberg casket consists of an oak-wood box covered in panels of walrus ivory and bronze. These in turn are decorated with Viking Mammen-style ornaments. Although found in Germany, this c. 10th century casket was most likely made in Scandinavia.

                Did women fight alongside men on the Viking age? A large number of silver pendant depicting female warriors seem to suggest so. This fighting woman is however a valkyrie ready to roam the battlefield in search of Odin’s chosen slain. This gilded silver pendant or pin-top was found at Hårby in Denmark.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                The horse had a special meaning for the Vikings, it was almost a sacred animal, and the foremost sacrificial animal. Horsemeat was food for gods and men alike, and the gods all owned horses. For the average farmer the horse was the most important ‘beast of burden’, and for the elite, something to go hunting on. In warfare it was not very commonly used except as a means of transportation to and from the battlefield.

            <p class="main-text">
                The Viking Age was a transition period between heathendom and christianity, and some enterprising craftsman took advantage of this and offered symbols of both faiths. This crucible features both the christian cross and the hammer of Thor. The cross is from Jelling and the Thors hammer from Rømesdal, Denmark.

                The Viking Age could have been lost, if not for the saga writers of Iceland, who found interest in the heathen and ancient kings of Norway. This magnificent page is the first page in Snorre Sturlasson’s Kringla Heimsins; The saga of the kings of Norway. Its handwritten on calfskin and is a copy from between 1300-1324.

                This bronze decorated bucket of irish-celtic origin was discovered in the Oseberg boat burial. It was called “the Buddha bucket” because of the two small figurines sitting with their legs crossed by the handle - resembling Buddha. Although probably just celtic gods, it was certainly brought back from Ireland, and became a prized possession of the Oseberg queen.

                The rooster Gullinkambi (Golden Comb) wakes the Viking warriors in Valhall every morning and it will crow at the beginning of Ragnarok. You can see him on this magnificent axe from the Mammen burial site. It is made of iron with silver inlay and is decorated in the so-called Mammen style. On the other side it shows the pagan tree Yggdrasil in which the rooster dwells.
