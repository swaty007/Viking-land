                The blacksmith was one of the most essential craftsmen during the Viking Age. He produced iron weapons, tools and utensils. The blacksmith wore a simple, plant-dyed linen kirtle and a leather apron. Wide-legged trousers were common during the Viking Age, and were used all over Scandinavia during this period. This assumption is based on various images from jewellery and textiles. The shoes are inspired by finds from the Oseberg burial mound in Vestfold, Norway.

                The mistress of the house was a key figure in Norse culture, which focused on rural farming culture. Women were bearers of traditions and practical knowledge. The mistress of the house wears a linen "serk" (underdress), with a aprondress in diamond twill wool fabric. Her oval brooches are from finds in Hof in Vestfold, and date from the 800s. Her bead necklace is based on finds from the Oseberg mound. The knife, bone needle case and scissors are common accessories and hang from the brooches. Her head covering is inferred, based on a description of the "sveigr", a long piece of fabric a woman wound around her head. The mistress holds a whalebone plaque, which was perhaps used in sewing as a surface for smoothing out seams and for ironing smaller pieces of fabric. This is based on finds from Norway.

                Vikings took numerous slaves, both at home in Scandinavia and in the regions they visited. Slaves made up a large part of the work force, and at most, they comprised about 30% of the Scandinavian population. This slave is wearing a simple outfit made of natural linen and an iron collar, based on finds from the merchant town Birka in Sweden. The slave’s primary tasks involved working on the farm and caring for livestock. Some slaves were given trusted positions. Slaves could potentially win their freedom by showing courage and loyalty to their masters.

                Among the finds of the famous Oseberg mound were the remains of a woman of high stature. The remnants of her garments indicate that she most likely wore a hand-sewn dress of diamond twill, madder-dyed red. The silk embroidery is a copy of that found in the burial mound. Silk was appliqued in ribbons. The cut was inspired by French fashion at the time, copied by the upper classes. The dress also has a train, as found depicted on several pieces of jewellery from this period.

This volve wears a woollen dress in natural brown wool. She also wears a cloak of blue wool with silk edges. This is freely inferred from a description by Erik the Red’s Saga. It is fastened with a cloak brooch clasp based on finds from Birka. In her hands, she holds a “volvestaff”, which is an iron staff with bronze ornamentation. Such staffs have been found in several larger excavations of female burial mounds, and are considered symbols of the women’s status as ritual leaders.

                Young unmarried women from the city communities may have had better opportunities for personal development than women in the rural villages. Music and singing skills were sought after, and in the city communities and chieftain halls, musicians could provide entertainment and create an atmosphere. She wears a naturally white handsewn linen “serk” with a simple strap dress and tabletwovenband from Vestrum in Vestfold. She has a long, woad-dyed, blue coat and shoes, based on finds from Hedeby in Denmark. Since she is unmarried, she does not wear oval brooches. The lyre is inspired by finds from periods prior to and following the Viking Age.
