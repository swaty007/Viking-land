                Like the Vikings, Viking Kristall work in silver, bronze and gold, and only use genuine stones and crystals in their jewellery. Their silversmiths have mastered the exact techniques employed a thousand years ago.

                After centuries in the grave, the Viking aesthetic has been brought back to life. Viking design still captivates people today. Ancient symbols have a timeless appeal. Viking Kristall take pride in giving new life to the Nordic Viking heritage.
