               The Viking Age extends from the mid-700s until the end of the 1000s. The Nordic region then stretched far beyond todayâ€™s borders and was a multicultural melting pot consisting of many different races and nations. These new arrivals and alliances caused the community to change constantly, embracing new ideas and inventions. War ideology permeated society at all levels and the pursuit of honor, wealth and land was a powerful incentive for looting, trade and expansion. It was a time when handicrafts, poetry and technological innovation flowered, but also one of transition, with ancient pagan culture about to give way to a new Christian worldview.
