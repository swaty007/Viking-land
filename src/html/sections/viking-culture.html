            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Like you, we’ve watched countless movies and series about the Vikings – but none of them accurately depicts what the Viking life really was like. We’ve asked our historian Kim Hjardar to debunk a few viking myths for you.

            <p class="main-text">
                The Vikings developed an advanced art form called Animal Style, with which they decorated ships, houses, textiles and jewelry. The style evolved over time, borrowing aspects from Italian, Byzantine, and frankish trends in the process.

            <p class="main-text">
                Viking men’s hair and beards would always be groomed and looked after. Having beard was a sign of virility and manhood. One could be called “beardless” in the sense of a young and immature person. In adult men, beardlessness was probably considered a blemish.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Nearly 1 in 3 people living in Scandinavia were slaves. The Viking Age was a society where up to 30% of the population lived in slavery. Some rich people could even have hundreds of slaves working on the land. Slaves were captured all over the known world and taken home, and some Viking children who weren’t recognised by their family were also given a short life as slaves.

                Brooches of different types were used. One of the most popular was the triple-breasted brooch, which originated from French sword buckles that had been robbed and taken back.

                The Viking Age is called the “Silver Age”. There was no official Viking currency, and value was measured in silver weight – Vikings would carry silver bracelets and torques, and they broke off pieces when they needed to pay for something.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                Our days of the week are named after gods worshipped by Vikings. An early version of the god Odin, known as Woden, gave us Wednesday (literally, Woden’s Day*). Meanwhile, Tuesday and Friday are named after Tyr and Frigg, the god and goddess of war and marriage, respectively. Finally, and possibly most famously, the Norse god of thunder and strength Thor gave its name to Thursday.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                The Vikings used what we call relative chronology instead of established years. They would use seasons and significant events to measure time, such as “four winters after Hakon became king”. The year was divided into two equally long periods, Sumar (summer) and Vetur (winter), and one man’s age was always counted in the number of winters.

            <p class="main-text">
                The Berserkers and the Wolfskin warriors were special types of warriors who were associated with the god Odin. They are characterized by their ecstatic war rage and could, according to the sources, show superhuman strength. They attacked while howling like dogs or wolves, and it was believed that neither iron nor fire could hurt them, and they did not know pain.

            <p class="main-text">
                An insult, gossip or an abusive word was enough for you to demand a duel. In the Viking Age there were two types of combat: ‘Envig’ (One-battle), which was fought to death, and ‘Holmgang’ (battle on an island), which had many rules and didn’t not necessarily end with the death of the losing side.

            </h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                In the Viking Age, it was rare to get older than fifty years. Most people died long before this, either by illness and struggle, or perhaps by war. The few who managed to live through adult life and reach old age would suffer a shameful fate: they lost their property and honor and often became a burden to society.

            <p class="main-text">
                On the contrary to popular belief, Vikings never wore winged nor horned helmets; Ornamented Viking helmets entered popular culture in the 19th century when writers, musicians and artists romanticised Scandinavian figures such as Valkyries, gods and famous raiders or explorers.

            <p class="main-text">
                The Vikings sacrificed animals from time to time, as well as people. In times of turmoil, before big battles or in connection with important burial rituals, a human being was the most potent offering one could give to the Norse gods. One of the biggest sacrifice festival took place in winter and was called Jól – the words ‘Juletide’ in English and ‘Jul’ (Christmas) in Scandinavian languages actually derives from the term.

            <p class="main-text">
                Viking were known to have a better hygiene than most other european cultures at the time, but they had no qualms about harnessing the power of human waste product. They would collect a fungus called ‘touchwood’ from tree bark and boil it for several days in urine before beating it into a soft and flexible material similar to felt. The sodium nitrate found in urine would allow the material to smolder rather than burn, so Vikings could take fire with them on the go. It is also known that Viking women collected urine from drunk men to use as a fixing agent when making blue dye for clothing.

                In the late 700s, the Vikings were known as fashion trendsetters. The court of Northumbria was criticized by the English scholar, clergyman, poet and teacher Alcuin of York for imitating the Viking’s hair and clothing fashion.

                Scandinavians developed primitive skis at least 6,000 years ago. By the Viking Age, Norsemen regarded skiing as an efficient way to get around and a popular form of recreation. In the pre-Viking era, Scandinavians even worshipped a god of skiing, Ullr.
