           <p class="main-text">In groundbreaking volumetric capture VR, with haptic 4D chairs and with a cinema soundtrack, - the audience will be transported back more than a thousand years ago to the western coast of Norway, outside of Karm√∏y.
               Onboard a Viking ship during a Viking raid at the end of the ninth century. Based on thousands of photogrammetric images shot on the real location in Norway and with a vast number of actors and stunt performers captured live in a volumetric green screen studio with more than a hundred cameras to be programmed inside a game engine, this is the first Virtual Reality experience of its kind in the world.
               The story starts around the campfire where the films protagonist tells his tale leading us to the nerve wrecking raid itself, where many men will meet their maker.
           </p>
           <p class="main-text">
               The Ambush is showing four times an hour and has a running time of 12 minutes and is one of several immersive experiences in The Viking Planet.
               Produced in collaboration with RSA Films and Dimension Studio in the UK.
